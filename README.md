## Game Overview

The player controls a basket to catch apples falling from the sky. The goal is to catch a certain number of apples to win, while avoiding missing too many. Adding to the challenge, sheep roam the ground. If an apple falls and isn't caught, a nearby sheep might decide it's a tasty snack, eat it, and grow larger!

## Features

*   **Scoring System:** Gain points for each apple caught.
*   **Win/Lose Conditions:**

    *   Lose if too many apples are missed (`LOSE_LIMIT`).
*   **Interactive Sheep:**
    *   Sheep wander the game area.
    *   They detect and move towards fallen apples within their range.
    *   Sheep "eat" fallen apples, removing them from play.
    *   **Sheep grow in size** each time they successfully eat an apple!
*   **Dynamic Apple Spawning:** Apples spawn at intervals with some randomization in position and speed.
*   **Visual Elements:**

*   **`P` Key:** Pause / Resume the game.
*   **`R` Key:** Restart the game (if game over or paused).
*   **`Esc` Key:** Exit the game.

## Technology Used

*   **Language:** C++
*   **Graphics API:** OpenGL
*   **Windowing/Input:** freeGLUT

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A C++ compiler (like G++).
*   OpenGL libraries.
*   freeGLUT development libraries.
    *   On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev`
    *   On Fedora: `sudo dnf install freeglut-devel`
    *   On macOS (with Homebrew): `brew install freeglut`
    *   For Windows: You might use MinGW/MSYS2 and install the `freeglut` package, or link against pre-compiled libraries.

### Compilation

Navigate to the directory containing `your_game_file.cpp` (replace with the actual .cpp file name) and compile using a command similar to this:

```bash
g++ your_game_file.cpp -o AppleCatcherSheepGrow -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm
